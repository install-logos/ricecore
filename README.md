# Ricecore
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/install-logos/ricecore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/install-logos/ricecore)
A ground up rewrite of RiceDB using Golang. 
Rather than meld the backend into the client's functionality like the original project, ricecore will serve as a
pure api which clients can easily utilize.
